# Driving School's website written in React

# https://auto-jedynka.pl/

## Description

I was tasked with creating a new website for a driving school owner who wanted to replace his old website with a more responsible and modern one. The goal was to create a website that would showcase the driving school's courses, provide information about the courses and the school itself, and create a more user-friendly experience for visitors.

To achieve this, I designed a modern and lean interface that highlights the courses offered by the driving school. The website provides detailed information about each course and its requirements, making it easier for potential students to choose the course that best fits their needs. Additionally, the website includes information about the school itself, such as its history, teaching philosophy, and accreditation.

One of the most significant features of the website is the custom-built CMS that enables logged-in users to manage website content easily. This feature allows the driving school owner to update and maintain the website with ease, ensuring that the information provided to visitors is always up-to-date.

We are proud to have created a website that meets the needs of the driving school owner and provides a more user-friendly experience to potential students. The website's modern and lean interface, detailed course descriptions, and user-friendly CMS make it an ideal resource for anyone interested in learning to drive.
